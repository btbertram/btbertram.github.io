                I’m a Game Developer with a BSc in Computer Games Programming from Teesside University Middlesbrough, and I have
                experience in Software Engineering from an internship at DuPont-Teijin Films. I use my experience working with C#, C++, Unity Game Engine, Unreal Engine 4,
                and other tools and languages used to create games and other applications. When I’m not working on my personal projects,
                I enjoy playing video games, travel, and using birdwatching to relax.

                <p>
                    A small party-game made in Unreal Engine 4 as a university project.
                    As part of team of nineteen people, we worked together to create this game in the timeframe of about four months.
                    As one of the three engineers, I was tasked with creating backend game systems, helping manage source control,
                    and sometimes debugging/optimizing blueprints created by the designers.
                    I also occasionally provided design input which made it into the final game.

                <p>
                    A technical demo made in Unity with SQLite, which served as my final university project.
                    This project was aimed at researching and implementing an external database as a backend system in a game.
                    The game includes several gameplay features through this system, including world and player persistence, achievements,
                    leaderboards, and additional features required to facilitate these,
                    such as a user account system and concurrent programming techniques to avoid application locks while queries were run.
                    The entire project can be seen on a github repository <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btbertram/TeesU-GPP">at this link</a>.

                <p>
                    A game system made in Ureal Engine 4. Using c++ and the UE4 API, this system randomly generates a simple maze and spawns it in an a UE4 level.
                    A key part of this system allows blueprint classes derived from key c++ classes to included in the generation algorithm,
                    letting enginners and designers work in tandem, while still keeping maintainable code.
                    This entire project can be seen on my github repository <a href="https://github.com/btbertram/UE4MazegenProject">at this link</a>.

                <p>
                    A small puzzle-action game made in Unity, where the player shifts rows and columns of different tiles to arrange them in specific patterns to clear them away.
                    This project is made on my own time, for fun! The technology is simple, implementing a basic search system to find matching patterns in the play area.

                    A turn-based tactical game prototype, made in Unity, as a university project.
                    As part of a team of three people, we were tasked with creating a game that showed off several AI programming techniques.
                    My role was to implement pathfinding, and the game implements an A* pathfinding algorithm.
                    Part of this also required implementation of a search system, which was also robust enough to be able to implement other searches,
                    able to provide elements of environmental information to the player and AI necessary for decision making.
                </p>

                        One of my group projects during final year was about AI in games. My task was pathfinding, and I implemented an A* search algorithm using a node-based system to make it happen.
                        That search system ended up getting a lot of use in other gameplay systems too, like decision making.
