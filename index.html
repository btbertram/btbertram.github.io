            <h3>Project Keystone</h3>
            <p>A small puzzle-action game made in Unity, where the player shifts rows and columns of different tiles to arrange them in specific patterns to clear them away.
            This project is made on my own time, for fun! The technology is simple, implementing a basic search system to find matching patterns in the play area. 
            A short clip of the first playable build can be see <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Brennan_Bertram/status/1382816902179790849?s=20">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>Yoink! Museum Heist</h3>
            <p>A small party-game made in Unreal Engine 4 as a university project.
            As part of team of nineteen people, we worked together to create this game in the timeframe of about four months.
            As one of the three engineers, I was tasked with creating backend game systems, helping manage source control,
            and sometimes debugging/optimizing blueprints created by the designers.
            I also occasionally provided design input which made it into the final game. 
            A video showcase of the game can be seen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52NqAlOfWWQ">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>EggsCompany</h3>
            <p>A turn-based tactical game prototype heavily inspired by XCOM: Enemy Unknown, made in Unity, as a university project.
            As part of a team of three people, we were tasked with creating a game that showed off several AI programming techniques.
            My role was to implement pathfinding, and the game implements an A* pathfinding algorithm.
            Part of this also required implementation of a search system, which was also robust enough to be able to implement other searches,
            able to provide elements of environmental information to the player and AI necessary for decision making. 
            A short clip of this system in action can be seen <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Brennan_Bertram/status/1380340920508325889?s=20">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Gatherin’ Game</h3>
            <p>A technical demo made in Unity with SQLite, which served as my final university project.
            This project was aimed at researching and implementing an external database as a backend system in a game.
            The game includes several gameplay features through this system, including world and player persistence, achievements,
            leaderboards, and additional features required to facilitate these,
            such as a user account system and concurrent programming techniques to avoid application locks while queries were run. 
            The entire project can be seen on a github repository <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/btbertram/TeesU-GPP">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I’m a Software Developer with a BSc in Computer Games Programming from Teesside University Middlesbrough,
            with some experience in Software Engineering. I have experience working with C#, C++, Unity Game Engine, Unreal Engine 4,
            and other tools and languages used to create games or other applications. When I’m not working on my personal projects, 
            I enjoy playing video games, travel, and using birdwatching to relax. </p>
